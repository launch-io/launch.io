# ![Launch.IO Logo](../../logo/logo-small.png) API Reference

Launch.IO relies on pure functions so it has the predictable state management and time travel debugging of [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), except there is no boilerplate and it's not Redux.

Its goals are to be tiny, fast, and super simple to use while still being an extremely capable state management library.

Grab yourself a bowl of ice cream, sit back, and enjoy the Launch.IO API. You'll likely finish these API documents before your bowl of ice cream.

Review the [Terminology](./terminology.md) before diving in.
