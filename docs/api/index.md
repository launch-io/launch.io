# ![Launch.IO Logo](../../logo/logo-small.png) API Reference

Launch.IO relies on pure functions so it has predictable state management and it can provide time travel debugging.

Its goals are to be tiny, fast, and super simple to use while still being an extremely capable and scalable state management library.

Grab yourself a bowl of ice cream, sit back, and enjoy the Launch.IO API. You'll likely finish these API documents before your bowl of ice cream.
